  translation: "Webアクセシビリティ オーバーレイとは何ですか？"
- id: topic01p01
  translation: "オーバーレイは、Webサイトのアクセシビリティを向上させることを目的とした技術の総称です。サードパーティのソースコード（多くはJavaScript）を読み込み、フロントエンドコードを改善します。"
- id: topic01p02
  translation: "アクセシビリティの向上を謳うWebサイトのアドオン製品は、1990年代後半に登場した<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoya_Corporation#ReadSpeaker">Readspeaker</a>や<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrowseAloud">Browsealoud</a>に遡ります。これらは、インストールされたWebサイトでテキストの読み上げ機能を追加するものでした。"
- id: topic01p03
  translation: "その後、そのようなソフトウェアに機能を追加した類似製品が、市場に出回るようになりました。それらは、読みやすさを向上させるために、文字サイズや色などをユーザーのニーズに基づきコントロールするものです。"
- id: topic01p04
  translation: "最近のオーバーレイ製品のなかには、支援技術からのアクセスしやすさを妨げる問題を修正することを目的としているものがあります。この製品は、コードをスキャンし、自動的に問題の修復を試みるスクリプトをページに読み込みます。"

  translation: "Webアクセシビリティ オーバーレイの例（アルファベット順）："
- id: topic01p06
  translation: "* すでに開発ないし販売されていない製品です"
- id: topic01p07
  translation: "オーバーレイ製品は、特定の市場に向けホワイトラベル化（別名で販売）されたり、リブランディングされたりすることがあるため、このページが取り上げる類の製品すべてを網羅しているわけではありません。"

  translation: "オーバーレイ「ウィジェット」の長所と短所"
- id: topic02p01
  translation: "オーバーレイ ウィジェットは不必要であり、技術スタックにおける位置づけは低い。"
- id: topic02p02
  translation: "上述のとおり、オーバーレイ製品のなかには、表示中のページの見た目を変更するための一連のコントロールを提供する、ウィジェットを含むものがあります。製品によっては、色のコントラストを変更したり、本文の文字サイズを大きくしたり、障害者のユーザー体験を向上させることを目的とした他の変更を加えることができます。"
- id: topic02p03
  translation: "一般的なユーザーからすると、それらの機能は有益に思えるかもしれません。しかし、そういった機能を必要とするユーザーは、Webに限らずあらゆるソフトウェアを利用するために必要な組み込み機能ないし追加のソフトウェアとしてすでに自身のコンピューターで利用しており、オーバーレイ製品の実用的価値は大いに誇張されています。"
- id: topic02p04
  translation: "従い、オーバーレイ ウィジェットの提供する機能がエンドユーザーに大いに役立つと考えるのは、間違いです。なぜなら、その機能がWebサイトを利用するために<strong>必要</strong>なものであるならば、ユーザーのアクセスするすべてのWebサイトで必要だからです。ウィジェットはせいぜい、ユーザーがすでに利用している機能の予備にすぎません。"
- id: topic03
  translation: "自動的な修正の長所と短所"
- id: topic03p01
  translation: "自動的な修正はある程度は可能ですが、長期的な解決策としてオーバーレイを使用することは控えるべきです。"
- id: topic03p02
  translation: "オーバーレイ製品のなかには、ページのアクセシビリティを修正することを目的とした機能を持つものがあります。その修正は、ユーザーがブラウザでページを読み込んだ際に適用されます。"
- id: topic03p03
  translation: "アクセシビリティに関わるさまざまな問題を、そのような方法で修復できることは確かですが、その種別や範囲、精度は、いくつかの重要な要素によって制限されます："
- id: topic03p04
  translation: "画像の代替テキストの自動的な修正は信頼できません。"
- id: topic03p05
  translation: "フォームにおけるラベルやエラー管理、エラー処理、フォーカス制御の自動的な修正は信頼できません。"
- id: topic03p06
  translation: "キーボードアクセスの自動的な修正は信頼できません。"
- id: topic03p07
  translation: "ReactJSやAngular、Vueを使用しているような、モダンなコンポーネントベースのユーザーインターフェースは、オーバーレイとは無関係にページのすべてまたは一部の状態を変更する可能性があり、JavaScriptによってコンテンツに加えられた変更に対して修正することができません。"
- id: topic03p08
  translation: "自動的な修正が、ページの読み込みを遅くしたり、支援技術ユーザーにとって予期せぬ変更を引き起こす可能性があります。"
- id: topic03p09
  translation: "上記に加えて、オーバーレイはFlashやJava、Silverlight、PDF、HTML5のCanvas、SVGまたはメディアファイルのコンテンツを修正しません。"

  translation: "Fitness for achieving compliance with accessibility standards"
- id: topic04p01
  translation: "While the use of an overlay may improve compliance with a handful of provisions in major accessibility standards, full compliance cannot be achieved with an overlay."
- id: topic04p02
  translation: "Among the many claims made by overlay vendors is the claim that the use of their product will bring the site into compliance with accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.x, related and derivative standards, and laws that mandate compliance with those standards."
- id: topic04p03
  translation: "Conformance to a standard means that you meet or satisfy the ‘requirements’ of the standard. In WCAG 2.0 the ‘requirements’ are the Success Criteria. To conform to WCAG 2.0, you need to satisfy the Success Criteria, that is, there is no content which violates the Success Criteria."
- id: topic04p04
  translation: "Given that conformance is defined as meeting all requirements of the standard, these products’ documented inability to repair <strong>all</strong> possible issues means that they cannot bring a website into compliance. Products marketed with such claims should be viewed with significant skepticism."
- id: topic05
  translation: "Privacy of personal data"
- id: topic05p01
  translation: "Adding an overlay to your site may run counter to end users’ preference for privacy and may create risk of noncompliance with GDPR, UK GDPR, CCPA, et al."
- id: topic05p02
  translation: "Overlays that automatically enable certain settings, like those for screen reader or speech recognition users, do so by detecting when an assistive technology is running on the device. This exposes the fact that the person using the device at the time has a disability. In certain cases, like screen reader users where the majority are blind or have low vision, it exposes even more detail about the nature of their disability. Like age, ethnic background, or preferred gender, disability is sensitive personal information. It is not data that should be collected without the informed consent of the person it belongs to."
- id: topic05p03
  translation: "Some overlays have been found to persist users’ settings across sites which use the same overlay. This is done by setting a cookie on the user’s computer. When the user enables a setting for an overlay feature on one site, the overlay will automatically turn on that feature on other sites. While the overlay company might think they’re doing good by the end user, the big privacy problem is that the user never opted in to be tracked and there’s also no ability to opt-out. Due to this lack of an opt-out (other than explicitly turning off that setting) this creates General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) risk for the overlay customer."

  translation: "In their own words"
- id: topic06p01
  translation: "Many users with disabilities have expressed strong words of dissatisfaction with overlay products. As shown below, overlays themselves may have accessibility problems significant enough for users to take steps to actively block overlays from appearing at all."
- id: topic06p02
  translation: "Please note: while this section may mention specific vendors, these comments are par-for-the-course when it comes to the user experience provided by overlay widgets which have, in themselves, a pattern of negatively impacting the user experience."
- id: topic06t01
  translation: "...assuming your tool can do a good job making something accessible, it can do an even better job making something accessible running directly on the user’s machine having access to machine code and machine APIs"
- id: topic06t02
  translation: "...I finally managed to gain access to my @NameCheap account by blocking #AccessiBe in my Windows Hosts file. I should not need to do this to use the Internet. AccessiBe needs to AccessiBeGone"
- id: topic06t03
  translation: "...I know with 100% certainty, any site which has deployed an overlay in the past year and a half has been less useable for both my wife and me—both blind."
- id: topic06t04
  translation: "...Still a pain to even try reading the article on a mobile device because of the constant interruption every few seconds. Considering every site using your service also has this problem… Nope."
- id: topic06t05
  translation: "...Making a webpage accessible does take work, and simply telling a business they can install your plugin is absolutely foolish, you build, and design accessibility in to a webpage using WCAG standards."
- id: topic06t06
  translation: "...Suggesting one line of code is cheap so you should do it by inference suggests disabled lives aren’t worth investing in either. #a11y"
- id: topic06t07
  translation: "@AccessiBe Just to demonstrate my good faith, here’s a quick free audit of https://t.co/1mQGCCtnIs. You capture \"tab\" which is the standard way to navigate. There’s no way to not enable your overlay if I want to navigate the page. Once the overlay is enabled, wild things happen."
- id: topic06t08
  translation: "#AccessiBe makes sites harder to use by getting in the way of browsing and changing access barriers on a page, not fixing them. A student and I came across an \"enhanced\" website and to my shame, we left because navigating that mess was beyond my skills, on that day."
- id: topic06t09
  translation: "Accessibility overlays are not the answer, and AccessiBe is no exception. As a screen reader user, numerous sites have become less usable for me with this overlay. Discrediting reputable accessiblity professionals and advocates will not sway me on this view. https://t.co/ZgFt8JtsbZ"
- id: topic06t10
  translation: "To screen reader-using followers: You may have heard of #Accessibe, an overlay that claims to make pages in which it is embedded more accessible. I won’t go into any more detail. In short: complete nonsense. Hands off!"
- id: topic06t11
  translation: "Automated solutions which promise to make your site accessible can’t. It takes more than automation to achieve this requirement. You won’t be safe from liability. you will almost assuredly negatively impact your customers with disabilities."
- id: topic06t12
  translation: "Every time I go on a website and I hear the #accessiBe notification that this site is adjusted to my screen reader, I know that my blocker isn’t working properly, and I’m in for a hellish experience on that particular website. https://t.co/ZFzKMfUe0t"
- id: topic06t13
  translation: "I tried using this @AccessiBe site with VoiceOver in Chrome on iOS. The 4-star rating is announced as \"unpronounceable\" 🤦‍♀️ https://t.co/f4MxQ2eLLP"
- id: topic06t14
  translation: "I wrote an email to their customer service detailing that I can not use their site due to the overlay, but… I really am disappointed, but I hope they listen. @Goodfair_ - please stop using AccessiBe."
- id: topic06t15
  translation: "I’m not an accessibility expert, just a screen reader user with decent skills telling you that this thread is spot on and my experience with #AccessiBe is that it makes sites with accessibility issues even harder to work around. https://t.co/cfyrEqXwTy"
- id: topic06t16
  translation: "...If you are blind or low vision and rely on assistive technologies like screen readers, you may have begun finding popular websites becoming less usable… this page describes how to ban AccessiBe from ever reaching your computer… https://t.co/qbiKvolizS"
- id: topic06t17
  translation: "OK, this seems very wrong to me. A local chain here named Fleet Farm is now using AccessiBe. It makes a mess of the search for location feature. This is what I now get on the start of the result page."
- id: topic06t18
  translation: "Thank goodness Firefox blocks their accessibility detection. For me, focus jumps all over the place with #AccessiBe enabled. When it’s disabled, it behaves itself."
- id: topic06t19
  translation: "There are 0 automated tools that can tetect accessibility problems accurately at anything above 30% of the time. 0. This is commonly known by anyone who’s been in this space for at least a week. #AccessiBe"
- id: topic06t20
  translation: "There’s a perfectly practical tool for making websites accessible. It’s called a programmer. The needs that matter in making a website accessible are those of the users. If you can’t meet those, then you can’t meet the basic costs of doing business."
- id: topic06t21
  translation: "When #AccessiBe is enabled, the page is flooded with headings. Lots of heading level 2’s. The title of each phone remains a heading in both versions of the page, but with it enabled, things like cost, display, and all the other components of the tables become headings as well."

  translation: "Conclusion"
- id: topic07p01
  translation: "No overlay product on the market can cause a website to become fully compliant with any existing accessibility standard and therefore cannot eliminate legal risk."
- id: topic07p02
  translation: "Accessibility on the Web is a big challenge, both for owners of websites and for the users of those websites. The invention of novel approaches to resolving this challenge is to be commended."
- id: topic07p03
  translation: "However, in the case of overlays—especially those which attempt to add widgets that present assistive features—the challenge is not being met. Even more problematic is the deceptive marketing provided by some overlay vendors who promise that implementing their product will give their customer’s sites immediate compliance with laws and standards."
- id: topic07p04
  translation: "The ineffectiveness of overlays is something that has broad agreement among accessibility practitioners, per the <a href=\"https://webaim.org/projects/practitionersurvey3/#overlay\">WebAIM Survey of Web Accessibility Practitioners</a> which found:"
- id: topic07p05
  translation: "A strong majority (67%) of respondents rate these tools as not at all or not very effective. Respondents with disabilities were even less favorable with 72% rating them not at all or not very effective, and only 2.4% rating them as very effective."
