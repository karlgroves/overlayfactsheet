  <h2 id="introduction-definition-and-history-of-web-accessibility-overlays">
    Introduction, definition, and history of web accessibility overlays
  </h2>
  <p class="summary">
    Overlays are a broad term for technologies aimed at improving the
    accessibility of a website by applying third-party source code (typically
    JavaScript) to make improvements to the front-end code of the website.
  </p>
  <p>Website add-on products purporting to improve accessibility go back to the
  late 1990s with products like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoya_Corporation#ReadSpeaker">Readspeaker</a>
  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrowseAloud">Browsealoud</a>. Both
  of which added text-to-speech capabilities to the website(s) on which they
  were installed.</p>
  <p>Later, similar products came to market that added additional tools to
  their software that allow user-based control of things like font-sizes and
  changes to the web pages colors so that contrast is improved. Products like
  Userway, EqualWeb, AudioEye, User1st, and accessiBe. These products may also
  be white labelled under additional names.</p>

  <h2 id="strengths-and-weaknesses-of-overlay-widgets">
    Strengths and weaknesses of overlay “widgets”
  </h2>
  <p class="summary">
    Overlay widgets are unnecessary and are poorly placed in the
    technology stack.
  </p>
  <p>As stated above, some overlay products contain widgets which present a
  series of controls that modify the presentation of the page they're on.
  Depending on the product, those changes may do things like change the page
  contrast, enlarge the size of the page's text, or perform other changes to
  the page that are intended to improve the experience for users with
  disabilities.</p>
  <p>To laypersons, these features may seem beneficial, but their practical
  value is largely overstated because the end users that these features claim
  to serve will already have the necessary features on their computer, either
  as a built-in feature or as an additional piece of software that the user
  needs to access not only the Web but all software.</p>
  <p>On this latter point, it is a mistake to believe that the features
  provided by the overlay widget will be of much use by end users because if
  those features were <strong>necessary</strong> to use the website, they'd be
  needed for all websites that the user interacts with. Instead, the widget is 
  as—at best—redundant functionality with what the user already has.</p>

  <h2 id="strengths-and-weaknesses-of-automated-repair">
      Strengths and weaknesses of automated repair
  </h2>
  <p class="summary">
    While some automated repair is possible, customers should be
    discouraged from using an overlay as a long-term solution.
  </p>
  <p>Some overlay products have capabilities aimed at providing accessibility
  repairs to the underlying page on which the overlay is added. These repairs
  are applied when the page loads in the user's browser.</p>
  <p>While it is true that a non-trivial array of accessibility problems can be
  repaired in this manner, the nature, extent, and accuracy of such repair are
  limited by a number of important factors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Automated application of text alternatives for images is not
    reliable</li>
    <li>Automated repair of field labels, error management, error handling, and
    focus control on forms is not reliable</li>
    <li>Automated repair of keyboard access is not reliable</li>
    <li>Modern, component-based user interfaces, such as those using ReactJS,
    Angular, or Vue may change the state of all or some of the underlying page
    independently of the overlay, rendering it unable to fix those
    JavaScript-driven changes to content.</li>
    <li>Repairs to the page can either slow down page load times or cause
    unexpected page changes for assistive technology users.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In addition to the above, overlays do not repair content in Flash, Java,
  Silverlight, PDF, HTML5 Canvas, SVG, or media files.</p>
  <p>An additional class of product exists, which only perform automated
  repairs and are marketed as a temporary solution. These include Amaze by
  Deque Systems, Alchemy by Level Access, and Sentinel by Tenon.
  <p>For purposes of this document, these products aren't considered to be in
  the same class of product as the overlays that provide widgets. The most
  notable difference, beyond the lack of a “widget” is that Amaze,
  Alchemy, and Sentinel are understood by their manufacturers as being intended
  for use as an <strong>interim</strong> solution.</p>

  <h2 id="fitness-for-achieving-compliance-with-accessibility-standards">
    Fitness for achieving compliance with accessibility standards
  </h2>
  <p class="summary">While the use of an overlay may improve
  compliance with a handful of provisions in major accessibility standards,
  full compliance cannot be achieved with an overlay.</p>
  <p>Among the many claims made by overlay vendors is the claim that the use of
  their product will being the site into compliance with accessibility
  standards such as WCAG 2.x, related and derivative standards, and laws that
  mandate compliance with those standards.</p>

  <blockquote class="conformance-quote">
    Conformance to a standard means that you meet or satisfy the
    ‘requirements’ of the standard. In WCAG 2.0 the
    ‘requirements’ are the Success Criteria. To conform to WCAG 2.0, you need
    to satisfy the Success Criteria, that is, there is no content which
    violates the Success Criteria.
    <cite>
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance">Understanding
    WCAG 2.0: Understanding Conformance</a>
    </cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Given that conformance is defined as meeting <strong>all</strong>
  requirements of the standard, these products' documented inability to repair
  all possible issues means that they cannot bring a website into compliance.
  Products marketed with such claims should be viewed with significant
  scepticism.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <h2 id="in-their-own-words">In their own words</h2>
    <p class="summary">
      Many users with disabilities have expressed strong words of
      dissatisfaction with overlay products. As shown below, overlays
      themselves may have accessibility problems significant enough for users
      to take steps to actively block overlays from appearing at all.
    </p>
    <p>Please note: while this section may mention specific vendors, these
    comments are par-for-the-course when it comes to the user experience
    provided by overlay widgets which have, in themselves, a pattern of
    negatively impacting the user experience.</p>

    Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p class="summary">
    No overlay product on the market can cause a website to become fully
    compliant with any existing accessibility standard and therefore cannot
    eliminate legal risk.
  </p>
  <p>Accessibility on the Web is a big challenge, both for owners of websites
  and for the users of those websites. The invention of novel approaches to
  resolving this challenge is to be commended.</p>
  <p>However, in the case of overlays—especially those which attempt to add
  widgets that present assistive features—the challenge is not being met. Even
  more problematic are the deceptive marketing provided by some overlay
  vendors who promise that implementing their product will give their
  customer's sites immediate compliance with laws and standards.</p>

  <h2 id="statement-from-sponsors-and-signatories-to-this-fact-sheet">
    Statement from sponsors and signatories to this fact sheet
  </h2>
  <p>As a result of the above information:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>We will never advocate, recommend, or integrate an overlay which
    deceptively markets itself as providing automated compliance with laws
    or standards.</li>
    <li>We will always advocate for the remediation of accessibility issues at
    the source of the original error.</li>
    <li>We will refuse to stay silent when overlay vendors use deception to
    market their products.</li>
    <li>More specifically, we hereby advocate for the removal of accessiBe,
    AudioEye, UserWay, User1st, MK-Sense, and all similar products and
    encourage the site owners who've implemented these products to use more
    robust, independent, and permanent strategies to making their sites
    more accessible.</li>
