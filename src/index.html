      What is a web accessibility overlay?
    </h2>
    <p class="summary">
      Overlays are a broad term for technologies that aim to improve the accessibility of a website. They apply third-party source code (typically JavaScript) to make improvements to the front-end code of the website.</p>
    <p>Website add-on products claiming to improve accessibility go back to the late 1990s with products like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoya_Corporation#ReadSpeaker">Readspeaker</a>
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrowseAloud">Browsealoud</a>. They added text-to-speech capabilities to the website(s) on which they were installed.</p>
    <p>Then similar products came to market that added more tools to their software. These allow user-based control of things like font-sizes and colors to improve readability.</p>
		<p>Some newer overlay products aim to fix any problems in the site's code that are preventing assistive technology from being used easily. They apply a script to the page which scans the code and automatically attempts to repair the problem.</p>
		<p>Some examples of web accessibility overlays (by alphabetical order):</p>
    <ul>

    <p>Overlay products are sometimes white labelled (sold under other names), or re-branded for certain markets, so this is not a complete list of the type of products discussed on this page.</p>

    <h2 id="strengths-and-weaknesses-of-overlay-widgets">
      Strengths and weaknesses of overlay “widgets”
    </h2>
    <p class="summary">
      Overlay widgets are unnecessary and are poorly placed in the technology stack.
    </p>
    <p>As stated above, some overlay products contain widgets which present a
      series of controls that modify the presentation of the page they're on.
      Depending on the product, those changes may do things like change the page
      contrast, enlarge the size of the page's text, or perform other changes to
      the page that are intended to improve the experience for users with
      disabilities.</p>
    <p>To laypersons, these features may seem beneficial, but their practical
      value is largely overstated because the end users that these features claim
      to serve will already have the necessary features on their computer, either
      as a built-in feature or as an additional piece of software that the user
      needs to access not only the Web but all software.</p>
    <p>On this latter point, it is a mistake to believe that the features
      provided by the overlay widget will be of much use by end users because if
      those features were <strong>necessary</strong> to use the website, they'd be
      needed for all websites that the user interacts with. Instead, the widget is 
      —at best—redundant functionality with what the user already has.</p>

    <h2 id="strengths-and-weaknesses-of-automated-repair">
      Strengths and weaknesses of automated repair
    </h2>
    <p class="summary">
      While some automated repair is possible, customers should be
      discouraged from using an overlay as a long-term solution.
    </p>
    <p>Some overlay products have capabilities aimed at providing accessibility
      repairs to the underlying page on which the overlay is added. These repairs
      are applied when the page loads in the user's browser.</p>
    <p>While it is true that a non-trivial array of accessibility problems can be
      repaired in this manner, the nature, extent, and accuracy of such repair are
      limited by a number of important factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated application of text alternatives for images is not
        reliable
      </li>
      <li>Automated repair of field labels, error management, error handling, and
        focus control on forms is not reliable
      </li>
      <li>Automated repair of keyboard access is not reliable</li>
      <li>Modern, component-based user interfaces, such as those using ReactJS,
        Angular, or Vue may change the state of all or some of the underlying page
        independently of the overlay, rendering it unable to fix those
        JavaScript-driven changes to content.
      </li>
      <li>Repairs to the page can either slow down page load times or cause
        unexpected page changes for assistive technology users.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to the above, overlays do not repair content in Flash, Java,
      Silverlight, PDF, HTML5 Canvas, SVG, or media files.</p>

    <h2 id="fitness-for-achieving-compliance-with-accessibility-standards">
      Fitness for achieving compliance with accessibility standards
    </h2>
    <p class="summary">While the use of an overlay may improve
      compliance with a handful of provisions in major accessibility standards,
      full compliance cannot be achieved with an overlay.</p>
    <p>Among the many claims made by overlay vendors is the claim that the use of
      their product will bring the site into compliance with accessibility
      standards such as WCAG 2.x, related and derivative standards, and laws that
      mandate compliance with those standards.</p>

    <blockquote class="conformance-quote">
      Conformance to a standard means that you meet or satisfy the
      ‘requirements’ of the standard. In WCAG 2.0 the
      ‘requirements’ are the Success Criteria. To conform to WCAG 2.0, you need
      to satisfy the Success Criteria, that is, there is no content which
      violates the Success Criteria.
      <cite>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance">Understanding
          WCAG 2.1: Understanding Conformance</a>
      </cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Given that conformance is defined as meeting <strong>all</strong>
      requirements of the standard, these products' documented inability to repair
      all possible issues means that they cannot bring a website into compliance.
      Products marketed with such claims should be viewed with significant
      skepticism.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <h2 id="privacy">Privacy of personal data</h2>
    <p class="summary">Adding an overlay to your site may run counter to end users' preference for privacy and may create risk of noncompliance with GDPR, UK GDPR, CCPA, et al.</p>

    <p>Overlays that automatically enable certain settings, like those for screen reader or speech recognition users, do
      so by detecting when an assistive technology is running on the device. This exposes the fact that the person using
      the device at the time has a disability. In certain cases, like screen reader users where the majority are blind
      or have low vision, it exposes even more detail about the nature of their disability. Like age, ethnic background,
      or preferred gender, disability is sensitive personal information. It is not data that should be collected without
      the informed consent of the person it belongs to.</p>

    <p>Some overlays have been found to persist users' settings across sites which use the same overlay. This is done by
      setting a cookie on the user's computer. When the user enables a setting for an overlay feature on one site, the
      overlay will automatically turn on that feature on other sites. While the overlay company might think they're
      doing good by the end user, the big privacy problem is that the user never opted in to be tracked and there's also no
      ability to opt-out. Due to this lack of an opt-out (other than explicitly turning off that setting) this creates
      General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) risk for the overlay customer.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 id="in-their-own-words">In their own words</h2>
      <p class="summary">
        Many users with disabilities have expressed strong words of
        dissatisfaction with overlay products. As shown below, overlays
        themselves may have accessibility problems significant enough for users
        to take steps to actively block overlays from appearing at all.
      </p>
      <p>Please note: while this section may mention specific vendors, these
        comments are par-for-the-course when it comes to the user experience
        provided by overlay widgets which have, in themselves, a pattern of
        negatively impacting the user experience.</p>

        focus jumps all over the place with #AccessiBe enabled. When it's
        disabled, it behaves itself.

        There's a perfectly practical tool for making websites accessible. It's
        called a programmer. The needs that matter in making a website accessible
        are those of the users. If you can't meet those, then you can't meet the
        basic costs of doing business.

        When #AccessiBe is enabled, the page is flooded with headings. Lots of
        heading level 2's. The title of each phone remains a heading in both
        versions of the page, but with it enabled, things like cost, display, and
        all the other components of the tables become headings as well.

      Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p class="summary">
      No overlay product on the market can cause a website to become fully
      compliant with any existing accessibility standard and therefore cannot
      eliminate legal risk.
    </p>
    <p>Accessibility on the Web is a big challenge, both for owners of websites
      and for the users of those websites. The invention of novel approaches to
      resolving this challenge is to be commended.</p>
    <p>However, in the case of overlays—especially those which attempt to add
      widgets that present assistive features—the challenge is not being met. Even
      more problematic is the deceptive marketing provided by some overlay
      vendors who promise that implementing their product will give their
      customer's sites immediate compliance with laws and standards.</p>
    <p>The ineffectiveness of overlays is something that has broad agreement among
      accessibility practitioners, per the <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/practitionersurvey3/#overlay">WebAIM
        Survey of Web Accessibility Practitioners</a>
      which found:</p>
    <blockquote id="webaim-quote">A strong majority (67%) of respondents rate these tools as not at all or not very
      effective. Respondents with disabilities were even less favorable with 72% rating them not at all or not very
      effective, and only 2.4% rating them as very effective.

      Statement from sponsors and signatories to this fact sheet
    </h2>
    <p>As a result of the above information:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We will never advocate, recommend, or integrate an overlay which
        deceptively markets itself as providing automated compliance with laws
        or standards.
      </li>
      <li>We will always advocate for the remediation of accessibility issues at
        the source of the original error.
      </li>
      <li>We will refuse to stay silent when overlay vendors use deception to
        market their products.
      </li>
      <li>More specifically, we hereby advocate for the removal of web accessibility overlay and
        encourage the site owners who've implemented these products to use more
        robust, independent, and permanent strategies to making their sites
        more accessible.

      <p class="summary">Some overlay vendors have attempted to frame the overlay factsheet as an effort by their competitors to discredit them.
      Such overlay claims are a textbook case of an attempt to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting">gaslight</a> people to deflect criticism.</p>
